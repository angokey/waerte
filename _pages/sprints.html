<p>
  So you have listened to all the exciting topics on Django for three days and now 
  feel motivated do something about it. What could be a better motivation than 
  contributing to the very open source software you just listened to?
</p>
<p>
  On Thursday and Friday, you have the opportunity to do exactly that. 
  This is your opportunity to contribute to Open Source software. 
  Even if you haven't contributed before, this is also an option to take your 
  first steps. In the sprint, you can contribute to Django projects as you see fit, and if you need help, there will be a pool of experienced contributors to guide you. 
  You can also reach out through Discord in the sprints channel.
</p>
<p>
  Thursday - 10AM to 5PM<br/>
  Friday - 10AM to 5PM
</p>
<p>
  The Sprints are free for all conference participants. However, in order for us 
  to ensure we have catered for appropriate numbers, please keep your participation 
  status updated on the ticketing website (after buying your ticket).
