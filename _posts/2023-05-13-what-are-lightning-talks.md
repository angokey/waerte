Lightning talks are short, 5 minute talks on anything you like! Usually they will have a
connection to Django or Python in some way, but not always. This is your opportunity to tell
the whole DjangoCon Europe 2023 audience about something you're interested in or passionate
about!

Lightning talks are the last session of each day.

## Who can give a lightning talk?

You! Any conference attendee is welcome to submit a proposal for a lightning talk. Read on for
more details on how you do that.

## What's this about buckets?

At this year's DjangoCon Europe, we will be following the "bucket system" that's been used
at PyCon UK for the past several years with much success.

The gist is: there are two buckets.  One is for new speakers. The other one is for everyone
else. If you would like to submit a proposal for a lightning talk, you write your name, the
title of your talk, and a short description on an index card, and put it in the appropriate
bucket. Sometime during the day - usually at the lunch break - the programme team will review
the submissions and select the talks for that day's session, half from each bucket. This way
we get a good range of talks, and a mixture of new and experienced speakers.

Read more about the evolution of the bucket system in [Owen's blog post](https://owencampbell.me.uk/blogs/lightning_talks/).

## Why should I give a lightning talk?

If you're a new speaker lightning talks are a great way to get a taste of what it's like to give
a talk. It's also a way to try out an idea for a longer talk - often a lightning talk reappears
at the next year's conference as a full length entry in the programme.
