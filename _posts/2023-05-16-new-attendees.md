Are you coming to DjangoCon Europe for the first time?  Here's some information to help
you make the most of your time at the conference.

## Know the schedule

Have a look at the schedule in advance so you know which talks and workshops you especially
want to go to. If you're particularly interested in attending a workshop, remember that these
have limited availability, so make sure you get there early to get a space!

## Avoid the queues

Show up early to collect your badge - there's usually a queue on the first morning! 
Registration is open from 8am on Monday 29th May, although the conference doesn't start until
10am. Arrive early and have a chat to our sponsors and other attendees before the talks.

## Join the Discord community

In your ticket confirmation email, you will have a link to join our Discord server. This is
where you can connect with other attendees, get information about volunteering and social
get-togethers. There will also be channels during the conference where you will be able to
interact with speakers and ask questions.

## Make friends

Talk to as many people as possible. People will introduce you to other people and you can also introduce them to people youâ€™ve met. If this sounds terrifying, tell people it's your first time at a DjangoCon as a conversation starter. DjangoCon attendees are friendly and will be happy to talk to you if you're new!

Use the Pac-Man rule: if standing in a circle, leave a gap for new people to join.

Use the #social channel in Discord to find people to join for dinner, drinks, a walk around
our beautiful city, or anything else you want to do! This is a really great way to find other
people to hang out with, even if you didn't know anyone before you arrived.

## Volunteer

Volunteering at the conference is a great opportunity to meet other attendees, get 
involved with the community, and see how things happen behind the scenes!

Have a look at the [volunteers page](/volunteers/) and join the #volunteers channel on
Discord.

## Give a lightning talk

Speaking at a conference is a fantastic way to meet people - it's an easy way to begin a
conversation, and people will want to talk to you about it! If you're not already speaking
at DjangoCon Europe, consider submitting a proposal for a lightning talk. This is a 5 minute 
talk on anything you like! Find out more in our [lightning talks news post](/news/what-are-lightning-talks/).

## Explore the city

Have a look at our [guides to the city](/location/) for some ideas of things you can do around
Edinburgh. You can also ask any of the organisers - many of us live here and will be happy
to give you suggestions!
